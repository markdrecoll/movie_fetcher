## Instructions
Clone the repo down to your local computer. Open two terminals, one in the "backend" directory, and one in the "client" directory. Run npm install in both locations. Then in the backend terminal run node server.js. Confirm that the server is listening on port 5000. Then on the client terminal, run npm start. This will start the react page, and it will connect with the backend server. Database credentials and API keys are currently withheld. Reach out to request them for full functionality.
